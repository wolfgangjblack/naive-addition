      "1. **Keep it Civil** - Please be polite and respectful to others. Don't call people names or make personal attacks. We'll remove harassing comments, and ban repeat offenders. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Be Careful with spoilers** - Spoilers don't expire, no matter the game's age. Don't include major spoilers in a post title. Please put \"[SPOILER]\" in the title if the link or comments will contain untagged spoilers. Use spoiler markup in your comments if you chose not to put \"[SPOILER]\" in the title. Maliciously spoiling games for others will result in a temporary ban.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Self Promotion** - Self promotion can include any content in a post or comment that directs users to your own personal platform outside of Reddit (YouTube channel, social media, blog etc). We allow these posts at a ratio of 10:1 comments to self-promo posts. Links inside of reddit (Reddit image video uploader) and on our content whitelist do not fall under the 10:1 requirement. Action may be taken with Repeat offenders.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Generic/Off-Topic/Spam** - Spam consists of generic posts (Non-original posts, achievements, trophies etc), Off-topic posts, and memes/tier lists (Monday only). Common and/or general questions will be redirected to the Weekly Questions thread. Non-OC content (someone else’s artwork, cosplays etc) must follow a ratio of 5:1 comments to posts. Regardless of whether it’s uploaded on reddit or links outside of reddit.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **No Politics** - Don't bring political commentary to /r/FinalFantasy, as it often leads to divisive arguments and frustration. We'll remove such comments and posts.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Use the questions megathread** - If you have a short or general question, please use the questions thread stickied to the top of the subreddit in order to prevent clutter on the sub. Some common questions such as \"which game should I play?\" or \"where should I start with the series?\" may also be redirected to the questions thread.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **No Memes outside of Mondays** - No memes/image macros outside of \"Meme Monday\". For this purpose \"Meme Monday\" runs from 12:00 am EST to 11:59 pm EST. Therefore, any meme/macro/\"caption\" image that is posted outside of this time will be deleted. If it looks like a meme, it will be removed. This also includes tier lists.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Post Tagging** - Any original works (artwork, cosplay, music etc) is required to have [OC] at the beginning of the thread title OR be obvious that you are the creator. Non-OC works (artwork, cosplay, music etc) must credit the original artist in brackets at the end of the title i.e. “[Artist Credit]”.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **No Illegal and explicit content** - Any post or content discussing ROMs, pirated content, copyright infringement, sales or pornography will be removed.\n",
